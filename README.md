### Hi! So im taking a PESU IO course and my throat hurts at the end of the class. I made this bash script `take_attendance.bash`. 
It basically reads out names for me and for each name, I have 3 options:
1. (a) for absent -> this marks the student absent
2. (p) for present -> this marks the student present
3. (r) for repeat -> this repeats the name

There is another script called `convert.zsh`, this script takes input as the names of the students and outputs file called `student_names.txt` which is a *comma separated* ***txt*** file! 
The `take_attendance.bash` script takes in `student_names.txt` as the input of student names and uses a python package to convert the names to voice files. It then uses `mpg123` to play the voice files.
